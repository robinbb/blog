For whom am I writing?

These posts are for software professionals of many kinds: programmers, project
managers, product managers, software engineers, system administrators, software
engineering managers, IT operations personnel, tech leads, VPs of software,
startup CTOs, and similar.

You are my targeted reader if you take ownership for the outcomes of the
software development process.

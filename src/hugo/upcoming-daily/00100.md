  Why I am writing about software development.

I chose a career in software development out of frustration that the practice
is not as it should be.

Humanity should be better at software development.

The process of developing software should be predictable, valuable, and
enjoyable. The software developed should be easy to understand, pleasant to
use, reliable, and safe. This is not how it is.

This status has not changed in the 38 years since I wrote my first line of
code.

We must do better.

I have learned a better way. I use proven techniques and practices of software
development in my daily work that make it enjoyable, and make the products
great. Others know these things too; I have learned from them. Yet, for
whatever reason, these practices are not ubiquitous.

I write about software development because I want you to know what I know.

These writings are to make you better at software development.

Enjoy.

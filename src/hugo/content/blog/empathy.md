Voss describes "tactical empathy" as the taking of inventory of the perspective
of your counterpart in an interaction, especially the aspects of the
perspective that we don't like. Being tactically empathetic entails calmly
describing those inventory elements back to the counterpart, without denials or disagreements.

Tactical empathy works with all humans because of how we are wired.

Empathy, as reported by Voss, is "describing and demonstrating an understanding
of the needs, interests, and perspectives of your counterpart without
necessarily agreeing. ... It's not about liking or sympathy in any way."

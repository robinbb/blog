If you are a software team leader, then you will need to make change on your
team or within your company.  That is by definition; leaders make change.

Social influence is what enables you to make change. Making time to develop
this influence is crucial.

Methodically developing your social influence is much more effective than
allowing your degree of social influence to develop "by accident". Make it part
of your routine.

In the worst case, failing to make influence-building a part of your routine
could result in you having no ability to make change.  I have seen entire teams
vaporize due to poor engagement and organizational dysfunction. Don't let this
happen to you.

How do you develop social influence? By growing legitimate relationships and
trust. By communicating with each of your team members. By understanding and
empathasizing.  This requires time.

Have a look at your schedule. When is the social influence built? Allot time
for the necessary communications.

Are _each_ of your team members considered in that influence-building schedule?

Make the building of relationships a part of your routine so that you are
positioned to make change when it is needed.

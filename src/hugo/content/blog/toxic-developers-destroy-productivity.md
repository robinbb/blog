If you are the leader of a software team, then you have heard of the legendary
10x developer - the superstar worker. To improve your team's productivity,
learn this: replacing an average worker with a superstar worker is not nearly
as effective as removing a toxic worker. It’s not even close. Toxic workers
destroy productivity.

[The science](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/16-057_d45c0b4f-fa19-49de-8f1b-4b12fe054fea.pdf)
is in on the effect of toxic workers. Avoiding a toxic worker (or converting a
toxic worker to an average worker) enhances performance to a much greater
extent than replacing an average worker with a superstar worker.

This is because the toxic worker significantly reduces the productivity and
engagement of other team members.

Often, employees who are not themselves toxic, but who experience toxicity in
the workplace:

  - Are less productive.
  - Become less engaged.
  - Spend less time at work.
  - Intentionally decrease the quality of their work!
  - Take out their frustrations on customers.
  - Are likely to quit.

Avoid toxic workers on your team. If you have a toxic team member, act
promptly.

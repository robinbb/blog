As the leader, it is your job to make sure that your software team's goals are
achievable.

The goals ought to result from a negotiaton with the software team.

I have been a part of teams where the goals were dictated by upper management.
This is a big mistake. Upper management is too disconnected from the software
development process to know whether their desires are realistic. If this is
happening in your company, don't let it stand.

As a leader in a situation like that, it is your responsibility to make the
change required.

In business, it is important that you do what you say you are going to do.
Some believe that software development is somehow exempt from this business
advice because it has too many unknows, because it is too difficult to predict.
So, they believe that actually achieving the goals is too much to ask of
software teams.

They are wrong.

It is your job as a software leader to have the skills required to negotiate
achievable goals and to know enough about the software development process to
arrange to meet the goals. You need to be a great software developer to lead
software teams because you need to know what is achievable and what's not.

If your team's goals are not achievable, then you need to make change.

It helps to have guidelines when designing your software build system. Here is
some advice regarding complexity of what is run on the CI machine.

It is not the purpose of the CI machine to test that everything is correct.
Why? Because that is impossible.

Shooting for that goal would result in an ever-increasing battery of tests that
run for each merged commit (or even *prior* to each merge on the merge request
branch).

Instead, target a 5-minute maximum between when a commit is pushed and when
feedback is received.

More thorough testing can happen via other automated pipelines. But, CI has to
be fast.

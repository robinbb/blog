I was wrong about what the software world needed.

When I initiated a career change to become a software leadership consultant, my
belief was that software leaders needed help leading. I thought that those
leaders knew well how to make software, but that they did not know well how to
lead a team to do the same. I thought that they needed help with people skills,
with socially organizing their teams, with defining and communication their
visions, or with creating psychologically safety.

I was wrong. This lack of leadership skill was not the problem getting in the
way of creating effective software teams

Time after time, team after team, company after company, the same truth
emerged: software leaders do not, in fact, know well how to make software.

So, the problem is simpler: teach the world how to better make software.

That's what this daily blog is about. Welcome.

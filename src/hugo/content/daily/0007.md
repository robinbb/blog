In designing your software build system, it helps to have guidelines. Here is
my best tip.

There should be a "single button press build".

That is, in the source repository, there should be a very clear way to perform
a build. For example, there should be an executable file in the root of the
project directory tree called `build`. Running it should result in an automated
build. If it fails, such as due to lack of available dependencies, then it
should clearly say so, and give instructions on how to rectify the problem.
Better yet, the 'build' program should rectify the problem itself, such as by
downloading the required dependencies.

This "single button press build" is difficult to achieve, but a worthy goal to
strive for.

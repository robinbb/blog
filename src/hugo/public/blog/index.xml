      <title>Mission Defines Success</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a software team is to complete a mission. If you are a software
team leader, your success is defined by the accomplishment of that mission; you
must own the result 100%.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Motivating Psychological Safety</title>
      <link>https://robinbb.com/blog/motivating-psychological-safety/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When team members feel safe to take risks and to exhibit vulnerability, team
performance improves. When that safety is absent, team members hold back ideas
and team performance is impeded. Leaders can increase team effectiveness by
creating a psychologically safe work environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Your Dev Team Needs A Mission</title>
      <link>https://robinbb.com/blog/your-dev-team-needs-a-mission/</link>

      <guid>https://robinbb.com/blog/your-dev-team-needs-a-mission/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Teams exist to complete a mission. If you are a software team leader, you must
ensure that the team’s mission is well defined and clearly communicated.
Without a clear mission, your team’s ability to make decisions is grossly
impeded, as is your ability to set goals and measure progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I have encountered many software shops in which the mission is unclear or
absent. Failing to clearly communicate a mission is a leadership mistake of the
highest order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://robinbb.com/blog/tip-repeat-yourself-often/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New leaders of software teams are frequently surprised that their messages do
not penetrate into their team’s collective consciousness. When communicating
with your team, repeat yourself often.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Toxic Developers Destroy Productivity</title>
      <link>https://robinbb.com/blog/toxic-developers-destroy-productivity/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are the leader of a software team, then you have heard of the legendary
10x developer - the superstar worker. To improve your team&amp;rsquo;s productivity,
learn this: replacing an average worker with a superstar worker is not nearly
as effective as removing a toxic worker. It’s not even close. Toxic workers
destroy productivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://robinbb.com/blog/tip-stop-solving-your-teams-problems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you lead a software team, and a team member has a problem, you may be
tempted to solve it. Maybe you shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity for more than a solved problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tip: They Don&#39;t Have to Like You</title>

      <guid>https://robinbb.com/blog/tip-they-dont-have-to-like-you/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you a software leader worried that the team members don’t like you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can stop worrying. They don’t have to like you. They just have to trust
you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tip: Coaching Means Giving Less Advice</title>
      <link>https://robinbb.com/blog/tip-coaching-means-giving-less-advice/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://robinbb.com/blog/tip-coaching-means-giving-less-advice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coaching well means giving less advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you lead a software team, then you probably deliver coaching for improving
certain behaviours of your team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing that, never give more than 3 pieces of advice. Your advice should be
constructive, never merely a critique. Aim for giving only 1 piece of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because we human beings have a limited capacity for change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tip: Routinely Develop Your Influence</title>
      <link>https://robinbb.com/blog/tip-routinely-develop-your-influence/</link>

      <guid>https://robinbb.com/blog/tip-routinely-develop-your-influence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a software team leader, then you will need to make change on your
team or within your company.  That is by definition; leaders make change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social influence is what enables you to make change. Making time to develop
this influence is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methodically developing your social influence is much more effective than
allowing your degree of social influence to develop &amp;ldquo;by accident&amp;rdquo;. Make it part
of your routine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Code Is Not An Asset</title>

      <guid>https://robinbb.com/blog/code-is-not-an-asset/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your software source code is not the asset that you might think it is. It is a
liability. More code means more liability. Are you making the right trade-offs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain what I mean by “code is a liability”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Employees Are More Important Than Customers and Investors</title>

      <guid>https://robinbb.com/blog/employees-are-more-important-than-customers-and-investors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New leaders of tech startups need to understand that engaged employees are the
best foundation for building a successful business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on what I have seen in Silicon Valley, not all new leaders have this
understanding. New leaders, I write this for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s skip to the punchline for you and your nascent business: employee
engagement is more important than your customers, and more important than your
investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like some of the new leaders that I have encountered, then you need
some convincing. Read on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

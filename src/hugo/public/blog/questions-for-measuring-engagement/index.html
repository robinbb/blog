software team, then consider measuring its degree of engagement. Measuring
engagement will help you to improve it.</p>
<p>This article recommends language to use in carefully selected questions for the
measurement of engagement of your software team.</p>
<p>Gallup has been collecting business metrics for decades; the company has been
able to authoritatively deduce which survey questions best measure engagement.
They have tuned a 12-item questionnaire (called The Gallup Q12) to measure it.
The Gallup Q12 has become the industry&rsquo;s gold standard for engagement.</p>
<p>In 2016, Gallup posted a pertinent summary of its meta-analysis of employee
engagement, including the text for the 12 questions. I won&rsquo;t repeat the key 12
questions here. Please see
<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236468/moneyball-business-employee-engagement-meta-analysis.aspx">that post</a>
before continuing.</p>
<p>Here, I explain how to better phrase those 12 survey questions for your
software team.</p>
<h3 id="the-term-at-work-is-now-ambiguous">The Term &ldquo;At Work&rdquo; Is Now Ambiguous</h3>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;at work&rdquo; is used frequently in the Q12, but in the new world of
work, the term is ambiguous.</p>
<p>In the new world of work, work is not done uniquely for one company, nor is it
done uniquely at the office.</p>
<p>Does &ldquo;at work&rdquo; refer to activities done solely at the office (where an employee
is &ldquo;at work&rdquo;)? What about company activities done &ldquo;at home&rdquo;? Can one be both
&ldquo;at work&rdquo; and &ldquo;at home&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The new work environment includes gigs and side hustles. If I work on my side
hustle while at the office, is that what we are asking about with the phrase
&ldquo;at work&rdquo;? Perhaps I have two jobs; does the phrase &ldquo;at work&rdquo; refer to both?</p>
<p>Because of societal changes, language changes in the survey questions are
required. The phrase &ldquo;at work&rdquo; must be revisited in each case.</p>
<h3 id="q01">Q01</h3>
<p>In this question about role clarity, the phrase &ldquo;at work&rdquo; is now ambiguous.</p>
<p>We must make sure that the survey question delivers information about <em>only</em>
the respondent&rsquo;s organizational affiliation for which you want to gather
engagement information.</p>
<p>My suggested new phrasing is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know what ${companyName} expects of me.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q02">Q02</h3>
<p>In this question, the concept of &ldquo;materials&rdquo; does not apply to software teams.
The analogue for material, in the context of software teams, is information -
credentials, access, permissions. Subscriptions to software-as-a-service are
often required for software team members to do their jobs.</p>
<p>I recommend splitting this question into 3 different questions in order to
collect the relevant data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have the equipment that I need to do my ${companyName} work properly.</p>
<p>I have the credentials, access, and permissions that I need to do my
${companyName} work properly.</p>
<p>I have the software licenses and service subscriptions that I need to do my
${companyName} work properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q03">Q03</h3>
<p>In this question, the phrase &ldquo;at work&rdquo; again yields ambiguity. Must the &ldquo;doing&rdquo;
occur at the office? What if &ldquo;what I do best&rdquo; is done at the office, but the
company didn&rsquo;t actually want me doing that work?</p>
<p>Here is a phrasing that corrects the ambiguity that has arisen due to changing
context - work-from-home, side hustles, and millenial work habits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For ${companyName}, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q04">Q04</h3>
<p>This question leaves open an opportunity for improvement - making it about the
company or organization. My suggested phrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last week, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work
for ${companyName}.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The unmodified phrasing from Gallup allows for the possibility that the
respondent is giving information unrelated to the company or organization,
which my phrasing avoids.</p>
<h3 id="q05">Q05</h3>
<p>This question could be more terse, and should avoid the &ldquo;at work&rdquo; phrasing
mentioned above.</p>
<p>Note that the phrase &ldquo;seems to care&rdquo; cannot be replaced with &ldquo;cares&rdquo;. Besides
the fact that it deviates too much from the well-measured Q12, it would require
the respondent to have tremendous faith in their own ability to judge caring.
The &ldquo;seems to care&rdquo; phrasing allows more doubt on the respondent&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>My suggested alternative phrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone from ${companyName} seems to care about me as a person.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q06">Q06</h3>
<p>In this question about opportunity to develop, the Gallup-standard &ldquo;at work&rdquo;
phrasing should be removed for the reasons discussed above. I suggest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone from ${companyName} encourages my development.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q07">Q07</h3>
<p>In this question about opinions counting, we again should avoid &ldquo;at work&rdquo;
phrasing. My alternative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In ${companyName}, my opinions seem to count.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q08">Q08</h3>
<p>In this question, the phrase &ldquo;my company&rdquo; is ambiguous. Do you mean the
respondent&rsquo;s side hustle business? Even if not, does the respondent even
consider ${companyName} to be &ldquo;their company&rdquo;? We must remove the ambiguity.</p>
<p>Also, the phrase &ldquo;my job&rdquo; would have been interpreted differently in prior
years than more recently. In prior years, it is more likely that respondents
interpreted &ldquo;my job&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;me in the job that I have with ${companyName}&rdquo;.
Now, it is more likely that respondents interpret &ldquo;my job&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;the role
that I now occupy but which might at some other time be occupied by someone
else&rdquo;. We must change the phrasing to achieve the interpretation of the the
respondents of prior years. I suggest &ldquo;my work for ${companyName}&rdquo;.</p>
<p>My suggestions give rise to this new phrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mission or purpose of ${companyName} makes me feel that my work for
${companyName} is important.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q09">Q09</h3>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;my associates or fellow employees&rdquo; gives rise to so much ambiguity,
I am surprised that it persists in the Q12. Is the respondent being asked
whether associates <em>and</em> fellow employees <em>generally</em> are committed to doing
quality work? Or, is the respondent being asked whether one group or the other
is <em>generally</em> committed to doing quality work? What if the fellow employees
are divided into &ldquo;associated&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-associated&rdquo; groups, then what is the
response to be if only one group is committed to doing quality work?</p>
<p>Due to the ambiguity about &ldquo;work&rdquo;, we also wonder whether respondents might
answer when thinking about their fellow employee&rsquo;s work on their side hustles,
and not about work done for the company.</p>
<p>My suggested alternative phrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My fellow ${companyName} workers are committed to doing quality work for
${companyName}.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q10">Q10</h3>
<p>Change &ldquo;at work&rdquo; like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a best friend at ${comanyName}.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q11">Q11</h3>
<p>Change &ldquo;at work&rdquo; as above, and also clarify that it is the respondent&rsquo;s
progress on company-related matters that is significant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last 6 months, someone in ${companyName} has talked to me about my
progress at ${companyName}.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="q12">Q12</h3>
<p>Change &ldquo;at work&rdquo; to specify that we are interested in the context of activities
done for the company:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This last year, I have had opportunities to learn and grow due to
${companyName}.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="caveat">Caveat</h3>
<p>This is my best effort to update the Q12 for the modern work environment.</p>
<p>While the Gallup Q12 are very well tested phrasings, my slightly altered
suggested phrasings, above, are untested.</p><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref">
